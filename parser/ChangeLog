    - New function pparamslist_add_array_valuef() in parlist library
	[Andrew Marchenko - adv@dp.nix.com.ua]

    - Renamed functions in strfn module (because old names causes conflict with
	standard functions on FreeBSD):

	isdecnumber -> strisdecnumber
	ishexnumber -> strishexnumber

    - New functions in strfn module:
	strend
	strcasestr

    - Header files was changed for use parser with C++ compilier

	Now parser can load files in two ways. It can either load file

	mechanism (mmap()+munmap).
    
    - I strongly suggest you to use new function for parsing - strparse.
	Old functions fstrparse and sstrparse now are wrappers for it.

	text.

    - WARNING! Removed "mimevalue", "jsvalue" and "nobrvalue" tags.
	This features was moved into parser_cgi module as "svalue ... mime",
