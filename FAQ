Q: How do I change the color scheme?

A: There are four color schemes available by default. They are classic
   (Borland-like blue scheme), dark (set by default, black background,
   etc), mc (inspired by Midnight Commander) and mono. To change a default
   color scheme for all the Motor users in your system, you should modify
   the /usr/local/share/motor/themes file and for a specific user,
   ~/.motor/themes. If it doesn't exist, just copy from /usr/local/share/motor.
   To choose between default schemes, just modify the second line in the
   file. "scheme <your preferred scheme name>", but if you want to create
   your own scheme, look below in the file. Also the file named "syntax"
   may be for interest in this case.

Q: I can't get out from a dialog or a menu. When I press ESC, nothing
   happens.

A: Have you ever used mc (Midnight commander)? It requires users to
   press ESC twice to close a dialog, menu, etc. It's not a problem, but
   just a terminal specific issue.

Q: Motor compiles way too slow on my box. What's wrong?

A: C++ compiler optimization being a rather slow thing is on by default.
   To turn it off, do the following.
   [konst@morgue]$ CXXFLAGS=-O0 ./configure && make

Q: The following error message is displayed every time I try to build
   the software. What's wrong?

    /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcurses
    collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
    make[2]: *** [motor] Error 1
    make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/me/motor/motor-3.0.0/src'
    make[1]: *** [install-recursive] Error 1
    make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/me/motor/motor-3.0.0/src'
    make: *** [install-recursive] Error 1

A: You either miss an ncurses library or haven't got appropriate backward
   compatibility links established. The latter is more possible. To fix
   this issue the following commands from the root user:

    # cd /usr/lib
    # ln -sf libncurses.a libcurses.a

   If this doesn't help, you do miss the whole ncurses library. Get it either
   from your Linux distribution package or from
   http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html

Q: Please explain how I do free a tty to use the gdb front end.

A: First, you can only use debugging locally. It means no ssh, telnet or
   something. Motor must be ran in a local console.

   Run this from root:

   # for i in /dev/tty[0-9] /dev/tty1[1-2]; do fuser $i; done

   At least one tty should be free, i.e. musn't be on the list which the
   command displays. If it's not terminate a program running on a tty
   you wanna use for debug. If it's used by a getty or something, remove
   it from your /etc/inittab file.

   Next, permissions. The free tty (not used by any program) should
   allow you to write there. Check it the following way:

   $ echo "test" >/dev/tty10

   if you want motor to run on the 10th console. If you have a problem
   with permissions, it says "permission denied". It can be corrected
   with the following command (from root):

   # chmod 666 /dev/tty10

   Voila. Now you do have a free tty to use Motor's gdb front-end.
