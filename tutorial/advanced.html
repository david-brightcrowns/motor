In the previous article named "Introducing Motor: A Programming IDE
for Linux", I covered the basics of software development using
Motor. Now I continue with a look at some advanced issues such as
debugging, organizing your libraries, version control and a bit
more. By the way, I've just released the new 2.0.0 version of Motor,
so features appearing in this latest release are also covered in this
article.

</P>


<H2>A Small Address to the Community</H2>

<P align="justify">

Currently, almost all the planned features of Motor have been implemented.
Now, I want to address all the GNU programmers who have experience in
programming with GTK+/GNOME. I realize that a lot of people work in X, so
my next big plan is to make a GNOME-based GUI version of Motor. If you
want to help me create a good IDE -- not only for console, but for X
too, please contact me and we will work out a strategy together.

</P>


<H2>Debugging with Motor</H2>

<P align="justify">

Motor has a useful front-end to gdb, a popular Linux debugger. Let's
check it out. Start by opening your favorite project to get a quick
insight on what happens inside the program in run time. I assume you
already have Motor running and you can see the editor window. For a
quick look at all the debug commands available, just press F10 and
then open the "Debug" sub-menu.

</P>

<H3>Before You Debug. Important Note</H3>

<P align="justify">

Motor can only debug programs in local console. That means that you
need to sit in front of your Linux/FreeBSD/whatever box and work on a
local tty. One of those you usually switch with Alt-F1..F12 :) Also
you should have a place to run a debug session, a free tty, Just like
X-Windows needs a free tty to start X display.

</P>

<H3>"Step into" and "Trace over"</H3>

<P align="justify">

Even a very minimalist gdb front-end allows you to run a program
line-by-line. That usually means you can see the line to be executed
highlighted on your screen, then press a key and move to the next line,
etc. till the program ends. During that, you can either trace into
subroutines called in the line of code or just jump over them to the next
line in the current routine. Motor lets you do it very easily. Just start
your program, not with "Run" (F12), but with the F8 key. The program
starts and then Motor positions and highlights the first line in the
main() function of your program. Then, pressing F8 or F7 (remember
the difference) you can go through all the program source cycling
into 'for' and 'while' constructions, entering and exiting functions, etc.

</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/snapshot05.png"></CENTER><br>


<H3>"Go to cursor" command</H3>

<P align="justify">

This option allows you to stop a program at any line in the code. To
do it, just position the cursor on the line you want Motor to stop the
program and press F4. The program will execute until this line is
reached. Then Motor will let you decide what to do next. You can
terminate the debug session with Ctrl-F12.

</P>

<H3>Breakpoints</H3>

<P align="justify">

A "breakpoint" makes your program stop every time a certain line in
the source is reached. To set a breakpoint at the specific line just
position the cursor and press Ctrl-B. The line will be highlighted and
next time it is passed, motor will stop and let you do further
debugging. If you press Ctrl-B on an already highlighted line,
breakpoint is removed. A list of the breakpoints can be invoked using Alt-B.

</P>

<H3>Inspecting Data</H3>

<H4>Evaluate/Modify Dialog</H4>

<P align="justify">

During debug, you may wish to see values of various variables to get a clear
view of what is happening in your code. The easiest way to see a value,
evaluate an expression or even modify some data is the "Evaluate/modify"
dialog. It is opened with the Alt-E key and contains the following
controls: expression to evaluate, its value and the "change" item.
Entered expressions are evaluated and their values are displayed. To
change the expression or its value, just position on an appropriate
item and press "Enter". But sometimes you might want to keep an eye on
some variable values all the time as you jump through the source code.
"Watches" is a useful feature in this case.

</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/snapshot07.png"></CENTER><br>


<H4>Watches</H4>

<P align="justify">

To watch variables or expression values, you should open the watches
window with Alt-W. Here you can add/remove watches or change values
of the variables being watched. Press ESC-ESC or Alt-W to switch back
to the editor or just Ctrl-D to close the window.

</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/snapshot08.png"></CENTER><br>


<H3>Inspecting Code</H3>

<H4>Call stack</H4>

<P align="justify">

A backtrace, a summary of how your program got to where it is, or call
stack, can be viewed with Alt-S key. It allows you to open an appropriate
part of the source code in the editor and view information about each
function call, such as parameters, file name and line number. Very
useful when you want to find out how long the way to the current line
in the source was.

</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/snapshot09.png"></CENTER><br>


<H4>Examining core dump files</H4>

<P align="justify">

Sometimes programs crash with "core dumped" message. Every time you
see this message a file named "core" is created in current directory.
Program can crash this way due to run-time problems ("segmentation
fault" is the most frequent cause) or it can be forced to dump core
and terminate with SIGQUIT (usually generated by the SysRq key), for
example. So what is core? It's a file that holds all the information
about your program before it crashed. It can be loaded then and all
the code around the line that crashed as well as the variables can be
inspected. Motor also allows you to load a core dump. All you need is
to select "Load core dump" in the "Debug" sub-menu and point it to the
'core' file. The information window will be displayed then and if
everything went ok, the point in source where the program crashed will
be highlighted. Now you can invoke a call stack viewer, etc. Note that
you're inspecting a core dump, a still image of your program state, so
no further program execution is possible.

</P>


<H2>Library Projects</H2>

<P align="justify">

All the IDEs I've seen before have had the same problem. If you
want to connect your own written library to a project and you are also
going to debug it along with your program, you had to include all the
library source files into your project. This I will say, is not a very
good way. So I decided to solve that inconvenience in Motor. With it,
you can easily add the whole library, which is built if needed, every
time you recompile a project. It can be easily removed from the project.

</P>

<H3>A Quick Example</H3>

<P align="justify">

Let's assume you have a library named tools. You created it from a
special template named "library/static". Then you write a program and
feel the need for this library. What should you do? It's enough just to
open the "Project files" dialog, position it on the "Connected libraries"
folder and press "Ins" or select "Add" item. The list of library
projects is displayed. All you need is to select it here and press
Enter. All the necessary paths and file names will be passed to the
compiler the next time you try to build the project. The library with all
of its attributes can be removed from the project in the same way.

</P>


<H2>Version Control</H2>

<P align="justify">

Being a Linux developer you must have heard about CVS. It's a powerful
version control system for Linux. But I'll explain what it is in a
few words for newbies. CVS allows you to keep track of all the changes
made to a program source. You can retrieve old versions of your code if
some bugs were added with the last modifications. Every change can be
commented and put into a history. Lets move on to how motor interacts with CVS.

</P>

<H3>Preparing a Repository</H3>

<P align="justify">

To be able to use CVS you should have a repository, place to put the stuff.
CVS can work though TCP/IP as well as in local mode. Here I'll explain
how to create a minimalist local repository. For further information about
setting up a CVS TCP/IP server, please consult the CVS documentation and
info pages.

</P>

<P align="justify">

First, make sure you have CVS installed in your system by typing cvs
on your command line. If you haven't got it, you can download it from
its web site at <A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/">www.cvshome.org</A>.

</P>

<P align="justify">

For example, you want the repository to reside in your home directory
in the cvsroot/ sub-dir. To create it, execute the following command.

</P>

<P align="justify"><B>

cvs -d /home/myusername/cvsroot init

</B></P>

</P>


<H3>Motor and CVS</H3>

<P align="justify">

To be able to use CVS with Motor, first of all you should point it to
the repositories you wanna work with. It can be done with the "Motor
settings" dialog, invoked either from the project list dialog or from
the "File" menu. You can see two options of switch kind here and a
list of CVS repositories. Press Ins to add one. A repository
specification consists of two parts: access method and path. For our
local repository we should specify the following:
<B>:local:/home/myusername/cvsroot</B> or just <B>/home/myusername/cvsroot</B>
since CVS assumes local mode by default. The other two options in the dialog
allow you to enable or disable "auto commit/update changes" made to
your projects when you open or close them.

</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/snapshot10.png"></CENTER><br>


<H3>Setting Up the Project Files</H3>

<P align="justify">

Now having at least one repository specified in your configuration, you
can easily put your project under version control. Press F10 to
activate the menu and select "CVS->Import into CVS" item. You will
be asked to select a repository to import a project into. Then wait a
while as the project is imported.

</P>


<H3>Imported. What next?</H3>

<P align="justify">

After importing the files of your project into the CVS repository you
can access all the CVS functionality. You can watch and then commit and/or
update changes, see the history and check out old releases and modifications.

</P>

<H4>Checking in and Out</H3>

<P align="justify">

After you select this item in the "Debug" menu, Motor runs CVS to
check for modifications in your source and compares your local version
with the repository. Then the report is displayed saying what files were
changed. In this dialog you can "Update" (synchronize your local copy
with the repository getting all the changes and applying them to your
local source), "Commit" (send your local changes in the repository)
and "Tag a release".

</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/snapshot11.png"></CENTER><br>


<H4>Tagging Releases</H3>

<P align="justify">

This option is useful when you think the source is ok (stable?) and
you want to put a milestone to be able to roll back in case any bugs
appear because of further modifications. It can be run from several
places: from the menu, from the check in/out dialog and from the
distribution generation dialog. After you select this item, you are
asked for a release name. Note, it must start with a letter. Once a
release is tagged, it appears on the release history every time you
invoke it.

</P>

<H4>Release and File Histories</H3>

<P align="justify">

Since the changes and comments are held in the repository, there must
be a way to view the history. There are two histories. File history
displays a chronological sequence of modifications and comments for
the current file open in the editor. With release history you can view
and check out either a single file or a whole set of source files from
previously tagged releases. Checked out source will replace your local
copies and be re-loaded in editor if necessary.

</P>
